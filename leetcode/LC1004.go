/*

Given a binary array nums and an integer k, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array if you can flip at most k 0's.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], k = 3
Output: 10
Explanation: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 105
nums[i] is either 0 or 1.
0 <= k <= nums.length

func LongestOnes(nums []int, k int) int {

	var left, zeroCount, maxLength int

	for right, val := range nums {
		if val == 0 {
			zeroCount++
		}

		for zeroCount > k {
			if nums[left] == 0 {
				zeroCount--
			}
			left++
		}
		if maxLength < right-left+1 {
			maxLength = right - left + 1
		}
